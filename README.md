# Atom-Sandbox
A browser-based sandbox game, where the player spawns atoms of the elements and experiments with them by creating molecules. The game was actually made by Trae AI, but the game idea is mine. The sounds were recorded by me using Audacity without any sound editing.

How the game works:
Player spawns atoms by clicking the "Spawn Atom" button. The atoms bond by colliding with each other. The atoms will unbond by left clicking on the bond.
Every element has a max amount of bonds, that it can form, like Hydrogen has only one bond, so it can bond with only one element.
The game considers only a mix of different bonded elements as a molecule. Things like C8 (8 carbon atoms, that are bonded) are not considered as a molecule, so the next rule does not apply. If a molecule has more than 4 free bonds, that are not bonded to any atom, the molecule will break appart after 5 seconds.
The atoms of the same element are interacting with each other by attracting and repelling, if they get too close to each other.
Have fun playing the game!
